## ü§ñ What is INGRES Chatbot?

The INGRES AI Chatbot is a sophisticated conversational interface that serves as your intelligent assistant for groundwater data queries. It combines the power of artificial intelligence with comprehensive groundwater datasets to provide:

### Core Capabilities
- **Natural Language Queries**: Ask questions in plain English about groundwater data
- **Real-time Streaming Responses**: Get immediate, contextual answers with smooth streaming
- **Interactive Code Examples**: View and copy code snippets for data analysis
- **Markdown Support**: Rich text formatting for comprehensive responses
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices

### Use Cases
- **Government Officials**: Quick access to policy-relevant groundwater statistics
- **Researchers**: Advanced data analysis and trend identification
- **General Public**: Simple queries about local groundwater conditions
- **Developers**: API integration examples and data access methods

## The Problem

The existing INGRES portal, while a valuable data repository, presents several challenges:
- **Poor User Experience:** Navigating vast datasets is complex and time-consuming.
- **Limited Accessibility:** The portal is not easily usable by non-experts or those who are not proficient in English.
- **Lack of Actionable Insights:** The data is presented in a raw format, without context or dynamic analysis.

## The Solution

Our solution is a multi-interface system centered around a conversational AI chatbot. It's built on a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** architecture to ensure accuracy and is tailored to meet the specific needs of different user groups.
